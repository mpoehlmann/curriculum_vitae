  \textsc{Oct 2021} & \textsc{\hl{Data analysis with Python seminar}}, \UCD \\
  & {\footnotesize After interacting with chemistry graduate students at UC Davis, I realized that the vast majority did repetitive data analysis manually and lacked fundamental programming skills.
  I organized and led a Python seminar for these PhD students which featured specific data analysis applications to their research.} \\

  \textsc{May 2021} & \textsc{\hl{DLT40 Pima School}}, \UCD \\
  & {\footnotesize The DLT40 Pima School is a program to give Pimaâ€™s high school students the opportunity to have a research experience with researchers at UC Davis and University of Arizona.
  Student used the skynet telescopes to collect astronomical data and used Python to analyze the data they collected.
  I gave a tutorial on Python and basic data analysis.} \\

  \emph{Present} & \textsc{\hl{Nuclear Forensics}}, \UCD \\
  \textsc{Jan 2020} & {\footnotesize Helped to develop an outreach program to provide undergraduate students with an introduction to experimental high energy physics. The program, entitled "Nuclear Forensics: Dusting for the Fingerprints of Radioactivity," seeks to provide untapped groups with a hands-on experience to identify trace radioisotopes through Neutron Activation Analysis.} \\
